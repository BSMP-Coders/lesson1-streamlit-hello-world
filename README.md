# Streamlit Hello-World: An Introduction

Welcome to the first lesson of the ðŸ¤– BSMP Advanced Coding Class, where we dive into the basics of Python and Streamlit. This lesson is designed to give you a hands-on introduction to creating interactive web applications with Streamlit, using Python as the backbone.

## What is Python?

Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It's widely utilized across various domains such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. Its simplicity and powerful libraries make Python an excellent choice for beginners and professionals alike.

## What is Streamlit?

Streamlit is an innovative open-source Python library that simplifies the process of creating and sharing beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science projects. It allows developers to turn data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes, all with minimal coding.
