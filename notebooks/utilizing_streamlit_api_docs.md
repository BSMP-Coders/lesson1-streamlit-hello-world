  ```  
- **Parameters**:  
  - `body` (str): The text to display as the header.  
   
**Code Example:**  
```python  
import streamlit as st  
   
st.title("Welcome to BSMP Coding Class on Streamlit ü§ñ")  
st.header("Lesson 1: Hello World")  
```  
   
#### Using Radio Buttons  
   
To create radio buttons, you can look up the `st.radio` function in the API Reference.  
   
**API Reference Entry for `st.radio`:**  
   
- **Description**: `st.radio` displays a radio button widget for selecting a single option from a list.  
- **Usage**:  
  ```python
