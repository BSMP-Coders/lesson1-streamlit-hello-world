Welcome to your first homework assignment for the Advanced Coding Streamlit course! This assignment will help you get familiar with creating a [multi-page](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/multipage-apps/overview) Streamlit app and using different features from the [Streamlit API reference](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference).  
You will create a Streamlit app with the following pages:  
1. **About Me**: A page where you introduce yourself.  
2. **Favorite Animals**: A page where you display a list of your favorite animals with images.  
3. **My Hobbies**: A page where you describe your hobbies and use interactive elements.  
4. **Fun Facts**: A page to share fun facts about yourself using columns and layout features.  
Each page should use different Streamlit components to display content.
